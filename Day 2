->did the easy problems(merge sorted arrays and contains duplicates) confidently and easily
learnt about hashsets and hashmaps
->Maximum subarray program a.k.a Kadanes algorithm felt dificult to be solved by myself - i completed it without looking into the solutions by just getting headstart from discussions section
->1295 and 1672 i did after seeing Kunal Kushwaha's video in youtube. was a simple and interesting program.
