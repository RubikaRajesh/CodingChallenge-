--comments--

->majority elements i did it through some long method then after thinking sometime i figured that its sooo simpleeee
->Rotate array- i kinda remember the method of approach-was able to solve it- had forgot to do k=k%n;
->product od array except self-- was completely new and had a little hard time figuring it out by myself 
  read method from discussion sections and was able to solve without looking into the solutions
