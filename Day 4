242,125,28(easy) ---> I actually struggled as I directly jumped into solving before re-learning the string concepts (would'nt recommed anyone)
                these where easy problems....but was tough for me today because i struggled to remember most inbuilt parts

Ceil in a Sorted Array --> was actually head breaking- with every testcase failing I learnt new things.
                           KUNAL KUSHWAHA'S solution didn't actually work for testcases with duplicates.

35--> was able to solve this with binary search there was no case of duplicate elements here,
      soo normal finding floor in sorted array method worked
744-->i was able to solve it by myself yay! i'm improvinggg
34-->was really easy to solve in O(n) complexity by linear search 
    but learnt and did it using binary search
